# **Welcome to Albania**

[View the live project here.](https://edmir-demaj.github.io/welcome-to-albania/)

Welcome to Albania is a site that is created to present the beauty of Albania. This site contains mostly images rather than text, as we say one image is equal to thousands words. The site gives information Why you should visit Albania, What is so special, What about food?
Welcome to Albania is a very helpful site for people who would like to travel, have holidays or explore the nature.

Check out how it looks in different devices:
