# **Welcome to Albania**

[View live project here.](https://edmir-demaj.github.io/welcome-to-albania/)

**Welcome to Albania** is a site created to present the beautiful nature of this Country. The site target anyone that loves to travel, go for holidays or explore nature. The site contains mostly images rather than text, as we say one image is equal to thousands words. Here users can find information why they should visit Albania, what is so special about this country and some description about food there.

Check out how it looks in different screen sizes:
