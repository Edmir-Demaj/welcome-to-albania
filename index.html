                <h2> Why visit Albania ?</h2>
                <p>If there is a destination that everyone should visit at least once in his or her lifetime, it is
                    Albania. This small country is one of the last hidden gems of Europe and totally worth a look.
                    From
                    the cliffside views of the sea to the deep blue water of the rivers, from the vibrant capital
                    city
                    Tirana to the stunning mountainous landscapes. <br> <em>Click</em> on the short video below to

                <h2> What is so special ?</h2>
                <p>Albania has some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe and even the world. Although
                    the Albanian Riviera is probably the most popular place to holiday in Albania the crowds are
                    nothing
                    compared to other parts of Europe. When you visit Albania, head straight for the Riviera and
                    explore
                    some of the hidden paradises that are waiting to be discovered. With crystal blue water,
                    white
                    sand
                    beaches and cheap beer, you will be happy with your decision to come here again. That's not
                    everything, plenty more to explore from Albanian nature with mountains, rivers, lakes and a
                    lot
                    more.

                <h2> What about food ?</h2>
                <p>One of the best reasons why everyone should include Albania in his or her bucket list’s places to
                    see
                    is the food. Albanian gastronomy is excellent, fresh and tasty. You can eat gorgeous dishes in
                    the
                    fanciest restaurants as well as amazing street foods. Albanian cuisine is primarily based on
                    healthy
                    ingredients such as vegetables, fruit, fish, dairy products, and meat. Olive oil is the most
                    popular
                    cooking fat used in traditional Albanian dishes. Herbs are widely used as well, adding distinct
                    and
                    delicious flavor to the food. Garlic is a staple, as are onions, which may be the most popular
                    ingredients in the entire country.
